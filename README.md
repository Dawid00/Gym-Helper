# Gym-Helper
It is my first project to learn how create application using Spring Boot.
I've tried to build feature-by-package architecture. The project is developed on Heroku
and available at https://gym-helper-dp.herokuapp.com/api

I've used:
Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSql, Liquibase
## Table of contents

## Description
This project allows you to easily save the results from the gym trainings.
You can:
* register and login as user
* save your planned or done trainings with exercises
* see history of trainings
* see list of example type of exercises


Every user's data is stored in database, where are tables: users, roles, users_roles, exercises, trainings.
I used JWT for authorization user.
